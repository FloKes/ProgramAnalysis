1. We can assign values to undeclared variables

2. We cant redeclare variables?

3. We MUST have a declaration andd statement otherwise it doesn't compile. We can't have just a declaration

2. Ask teacher about for example Figure 1.1 in book. Variable "x" there is not initialized so it just existts from before. Should our parser therefore not require that a variable be initialized before being used in the code

3. In the .g4 file the record has to have variable name R? that means we can only have one Record in the code at the time - Changed it to IDENTIFIER
