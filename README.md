# Program-Analysis-DTU-Fall-21

*Requires GraphViz and being able to run "dot" from terminal

When in root of project run command below: \
dot -Tpng src\main\java\graphviz/input.dot -o images\output.png

add your code in "test/test.txt" file

Basically this is a compiler but it has to be done faster :'(


If you want to generate antlr stuff for a change in the .g4 file you need to set up the output direcetory like this: Right click on MicroC.g4 file --> Configure ANTLR --> Output directory --> Change to your "project_location\src"
